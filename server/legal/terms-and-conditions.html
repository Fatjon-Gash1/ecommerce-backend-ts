            <h2>8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <h1>8.1 Governing Law</h1>
            <p>
                These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the
                laws of Germany, and the use of the United Nations Convention of
                Contracts for the International Sales of Goods is expressly
                excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a
                consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to
                you by obligatory provisions of the law in your country to
                residence. EdgeTech LLC and yourself both agree to submit to the
                non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Berlin, which means
                that you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection
                rights in regards to these Legal Terms in Germany, or in the EU
                country in which you reside.
            </p>
            <h1>8.2 Dispute Resolution</h1>
            <p><b>Informal Negotiations</b></p>
            <p>
                To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
                controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a
                "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either
                you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the
                "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any
                Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
                informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating
                arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
                notice from one Party to the other Party.
            </p>
            <p><b>Binding Arbitration</b></p>
            <p>
                Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties
                to these Legal Terms shall be determined by one arbitrator who
                will be chosen in accordance with the Arbitration and Internal
                Rules of the European Court of Arbitration being part of the
                European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg,
                and which are in force at the time the application for
                arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause
                constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Berlin,
                Germany.. The language of the proceedings shall be English.
                Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of Germany.
            </p>
            <p><b>Restrictions</b></p>
            <p>
                The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
                Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
                permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any
                other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any
                Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
                class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority
                for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
                capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
            </p>
            <p><b>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</b></p>
            <p>
                The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to
                the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding
                arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
                concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property
                rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
                allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
                unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If
                this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then
                neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within
                that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
                unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
                competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
                above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
                jurisdiction of that court.

                us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the
                entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these

                provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent
                permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and

                or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused
                by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
                part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be
                unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
